Hi, my name is Pavel Likin and this is my personal blog. I live in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia and I am a software developer.

My professional area of interests include programming and distributed systems. At free time I would like to  read fiction books or listen technical podcasts.
This blog will cover my interests.
